# Beth and Shirley's Northeastern Bookstore

## Description:
This project creates a program that manages books in a bookstore.
- Features:
Included are features for searching for a book by title or author. The user may also add or remove books from a Top 10 queue of books they want to read. The overall system takes a dataset of books and keeps track of it using a linked list data structure.

- Languages Used:
C and Python.

- Challenges:
Because of the large volume of data (250,000+ books) provided in the dataset, we ran into challenges of ingesting all of the data and instead chose to handle a smaller subset of the book data.

- Folder Structure:
Below is the folder structure and general organization of our project.
